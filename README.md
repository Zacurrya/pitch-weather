# Pitch Weather

A mobile-first web app that helps you find nearby football and cricket pitches, check their real-time opening hours, and — most importantly — see how wet or muddy the ground is likely to be before you travel.

Built with **React + Vite**, **Google Maps JavaScript API**, **OpenWeatherMap**, and **Open-Meteo**.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Weather Dashboard** | Full-screen weather view with condition-matched local backgrounds, air quality, UV index, humidity, visibility, wind compass, and **live forecast rain likelihood** |
| **Map-Aware Weather** | Weather data updates dynamically when panning the map. Uses ~1km coordinate bucketing for instant cache hits |
| **Hourly Strip** | 5-slot weather bar showing past-→-current-→-future conditions using Open-Meteo history and OWM forecast |
| **Pitch Finder** | Google Maps with sport-icon markers (football ⚽ / cricket 🏏). Search expands into a filterable list sorted by distance |
| **Search This Area** | Zoom-aware search button — radius scales dynamically with map zoom level |
| **Pitch Details** | Bottom-sheet with opening hours, photos, walking distance, website, Google Maps directions |
| **Photo Gallery** | Full-screen lightbox with pre-cached images, swipe navigation, and dot indicators |
| **Pitch Conditions** | Per-pitch wetness & muddiness algorithm (see below) |
| **Locate Me** | One-tap snap-to-location button |

## Pitch Condition Algorithm

When you tap a pitch, the app fetches **48 hours of hourly weather history specific to that pitch's coordinates** from the free [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/), then runs a weighted calculation to produce two 0–100% scores:

### Wetness (how likely the surface is wet)

| Factor | Weight | How it's calculated |
|---|---|---|
| Currently raining | 40% | `1.0` if the OWM condition is rain/drizzle/thunderstorm, else `0` |
| Recent rainfall | 35% | Total precipitation (mm) over 48h, capped at 15mm → linear 0–1 |
| Humidity | 15% | Current humidity mapped from 50–100% → linear 0–1 |
| Time since last rain | 10% | Hours since the most recent rainy hour, inverted over a 12h drying window |

### Muddiness (how likely the ground is soft/muddy)

| Factor | Weight | How it's calculated |
|---|---|---|
| 48h rainfall total | 45% | Total precipitation capped at 20mm → linear 0–1 |
| Sustained rain hours | 25% | Count of rainy hours ÷ total hours in the window |
| Temperature effect | 15% | Colder temps slow evaporation: mapped from 15°C→0°C → linear 0–1 |
| Humidity | 15% | Same as wetness humidity factor |

### Human-readable labels

| Percentage | Wetness Label | Muddiness Label |
|---|---|---|
| 0–14% | Bone Dry | Firm Ground |
| 15–29% | Probably Fine | Probably Fine |
| 30–49% | Possibly Damp | Possibly Muddy |
| 50–69% | Likely Wet | Likely Muddy |
| 70–100% | Definitely Wet | Definitely Muddy |

Results are **cached by place ID** in a module-level `Map`, so re-opening a pitch you've already viewed is instant (no re-fetch).
